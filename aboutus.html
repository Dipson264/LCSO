            <div class="text-gray-500">The Liberty County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) is one of the most
                active departments in the Springfield RP community. Our main
                purpose is to uphold the laws of Springfield and keep the
                community safe and secure. Our team of over 90 dedicated
                sheriffs works hard to protect Springfield, responding to calls,
                assisting the civilians, and maintaining peace in all areas of the
                Springfield.
                <br><br>
                The LCSO is organized into different divisions, each with specific
                responsibilities, so we can cover a wide range of situations
                effectively. These divisions allow our sheriffs to focus on specific
                areas of law enforcement. Each division plays a key role in our
                overall mission, ensuring that we’re always ready to meet the
                needs of the community.
                <br><br>
                We also have a structured rank system within the department.
                This rank system allows sheriffs to start in entry-level positions
                and work their way up to higher ranks. Moving up in rank
                provides opportunities to take on more responsibility and
                develop important skills. Each rank allows sheriffs to gain
                experience and knowledge so they can take on leadership roles
                within the department.

                                            minor disputes, traffic violations, and accidents. <br><br>

                                            This division is the first unit assigned to new sheriffs after they become
                                            whitelisted (WL) in the department, providing them with essential experience
                                            and training in law enforcement operations. By preventing crime, promoting
                                            safe driving, and responding to emergencies, the division plays a critical
                                            role in fostering a safe community environment.</p>
